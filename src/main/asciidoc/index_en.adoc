== Apache Software Foundation: The World’s Largest Open Source Foundation

== The ASF’s Mission
[.small]#The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is a US 501(c)(3) charitable organization.
Its mission is to provide Open Source software for the public good.
We do this by providing services and support for many like-minded software project communities of individuals who choose to join the ASF.#

A **neutral space** where projects which are **independent** from any corporate influence can prosper and create **Open Source software** for the **public good**. Under the business-friendly Apache License 2.0

== Established as a public charity in 1999

[.big]#*Mission: To provide software at no charge for the public good.*#

== ASF provides project governance
[.big]#The Apache Way#

== “The Apache Way” core principles
* Rough consensus and working code
* Small reversible steps
* Any constructive contribution DOES earn merit... while corporate affiliation and seniority DOESN’T
* Merit doesn't expire
* Merit doesn't give you authority; it gives you access
* No BDFLs, no vetoes - relying on building consensus instead

== !
[.big]#**“The Apache Way” +
AKA +
 “Community over code”**#

== Why the ASF Works: The Apache Way
* **Meritocracy** — Individuals earn merit by what they do and how.
* **Transparency** — Our projects are developed in the open, so everyone who wants to participate is able to.
* **Community** — We place community health over all else

[.big]#And yet it is NOT the right fit for every project#

== The Apache Way Ensures:
* Vendor Neutrality
* Diversity
* Trust
* Safety

[.small]#And also a number of Bronze sponsors, full up-to-date list at http://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html#

== Why existing projects come to Apache
* **Corporate Citizenship** — Give to charity
* **Higher Quality** — More developers with different perspectives
* **Collaboration vs Competition** — It's easier to work with competitors on open source projects that benefit everyone
* **“Free” Training** — The community can train your new developers easier than you can
* **Legal Protection** — The ASF protects contributors

== The Apache Incubator

* The official entry path for projects to enter The Apache Software Foundation.
