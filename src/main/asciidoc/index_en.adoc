== Apache Software Foundation: The World’s Largest Open Source Foundation

== The ASF’s Mission
[.small]#The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is a US 501(c)(3) charitable organization.
Its mission is to provide Open Source software for the public good.
We do this by providing services and support for many like-minded software project communities of individuals who choose to join the ASF.#

A **neutral space** where projects which are **independent** from any corporate influence can prosper and create **Open Source software** for the **public good**. Under the business-friendly Apache License 2.0

== Established as a public charity in 1999

[.big]#Mission: To provide software at no charge for the public good.#

== Apache Project Domains
* Artificial Intelligence
* Internet of Things
* Big Data
* Financial Management
* Climate Change

== Not Apache Project Domains [Yet]
* Robot Apocalypse
* Autonomous Vehicles
* Interplanetary Exploration
* Blockchain
* Your Project Here

== ASF provides project governance
[.big]#The Apache Way#

== “The Apache Way” core principles
* Rough consensus and working code
* Small reversible steps
* Any constructive contribution DOES earn merit... while corporate affiliation and seniority DOESN’T
* Merit doesn't expire
* Merit doesn't give you authority; it gives you access
* No BDFLs, no vetoes - relying on building consensus instead

== !
[.big]#**“The Apache Way” +
AKA +
 “Community over code”**#

== Why the ASF Works: The Apache Way
* **Meritocracy** — Individuals earn merit by what they do and how.
* **Transparency** — Our projects are developed in the open, so everyone who wants to participate is able to.
* **Community** — We place community health over all else

[.big]#And yet it is NOT the right fit for every project#

== The Apache Way Ensures:
* Vendor Neutrality
* Diversity
* Trust
* Safety

== Why existing projects come to Apache
* **Corporate Citizenship** — Give to charity
* **Higher Quality** — More developers with different perspectives
* **Collaboration vs Competition** — It's easier to work with competitors on open source projects that benefit everyone
* **“Free” Training** — The community can train your new developers easier than you can
* **Legal Protection** — The ASF protects contributors

== The Apache Incubator
[.twocolumns]
--
* The official entry path for projects to enter The Apache Software Foundation.
* Mentorship helps train communities in "The Apache Way".

* Takes 1-2 years sometimes longer
* Graduate to a Top Level Project
* Not all projects graduate

== Incubation: Build the Community
* **Users** — Users are the reason a project exists. No users ⇒ no project
* **Contributors** — Our projects depend on contributions from the community -- bug reports, email discussions, bug fixes, documentation
* **Committers** — Frequent contributors become committers after demonstrating merit
* **Project Management Committee Members** — The PMC is responsible for setting the direction of the project, authorizing releases, and voting new committers and PMC members

== Community
* **Politeness** — Be nice
* **Respect** — Everyone’s point of view has value
* **Trust** — Assume the best intentions
* **Humility** — Others might have better ideas

Code of conduct: https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html

== Incubation: Licensing is a key aspect
* **Provenance** — Establish where every line of code originated
* **Trademarks** — Must not conflict with existing names
* **Software Grants** — The owner of the intellectual property of existing code/test/documentation must grant rights to Apache
* **Contributor Licenses** — Contributions while at Apache are governed by contributor licenses:
** Copyright
** Patent
** Distribution/Modification


== Infrastructure: Keeping the wheels on
* **Mail lists** — “If it isn't on an archived list, it didn't happen”. Communication and review are essential to project governance.
* **Source repository** — Viewing all parts of the system is open to the public. Changes are made only by committers via procedures established by the PMC.
* **Build/Test**  — Most projects now incorporate continuous integration build and test processes.
* **Establish a Web Presence** — Each project has its own unique web page https://project.apache.org

== Release distributions
* Legally an act of the Foundation
** “Does NOT need to work”
** “Does need proper licensing”
* Authorized by the Project Management Committee
** Vote required
** Digital Signature(s) required
* Distributed via extensive mirror system

== Incubation: Graduation
[.twocolumns]
--
* Demonstrate that the project can operate independently:
** Self-governance
** Release management
* Establish legal framework
* Publicity

== Who is Willem Jiang ?
* Huawei OpenSource Center Techincal Expert
* Former RedHat Principle Engineer
* Apache Member
* VP Apache ServiceComb

== Apache License
* Universal donor
* Pragmatic
* Free for commercial and non-commercial use
* Compatible with other Open Source licenses

== Releases
* Are signed
* Need an incubating disclaimer
* Have LICENSE and NOTICE files
* Follows license terms of ALv2 and any included 3rd party software
* Source files have ASF headers
* Consist of source with no compiled code

== Voting on Releases
* Vote in the open on mailing list
* Vote open for 72 hours
* Release needs to comply with ASF policy
* Needs 3 +1 votes and more +1’s than -1’s
* A -1 vote (a veto) doesn't block the release
* -1 needs to have a reason to be valid
* Can change your vote
* If vote passes then the IPMC votes on the release
* If vote fails then create new release candidate and vote again

== Why you might vote -1
* Unexpected compiled code in release
* Includes software with incompatible license
* Issue with LICENSE and NOTICE files
* Issue with copyright
* Missing ASF headers
* Contains encryption software

== Practice makes perfect
* Not expected to get it right first off
* Licensing is complex
* May not be familiar with policy
* Policy doesn't cover all situations
* Policy is more guidelines, there are few absolute rules
* Release early and release often
* Each release better than the last

== Licensing
* **Category A** - can depend on and include in release
** MIT, 2 and 3 clause BSD
* **Category B** - can depend and may be able to include
** Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL), Eclipse Public License (EPL), Mozilla Public License (MPL), Creative Common Attribution (CC-A)
* **Category X** - can't depend on or include in release
** GPL, LGPL, non commercial licenses, JSON

== Binary releases
* Are not required
* Are not official releases
* Also need to follow policy

== Growing the community
* Recognizing merit
* Initially committers == PPMC
* PPMC appoint new committers and PPMC members

== Frequently Asked Questions
* What is BDFL
* What are Rule of 3 and Rule of 72
* What is JFDI
* What are RTC/CTR
* What is Lazy Consensus

== Support The ASF
* The ASF is funded through **tax-deductible contributions** from corporations, foundations, and private individuals
* **The ASF spends 10% or less on overhead**
* ASF Infrastructure keeps Apache critical support services running 24x7x365 for **less than US$5K per project/year**
* Help keep Apache software projects **freely available to ALL** around the world
