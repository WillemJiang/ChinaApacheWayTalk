== Apache软基金金会:
[.big]#世界最大的开源基金会#

== Apache基金会的使命
[.small]#Apache软基金金会 (ASF) 是一个根据美国法案 501(c)(3)注册公益性组织。
ASF的使命是通过向加入ASF的志同道合的软件项目社区提供服务，来为公众提供开源软件。#

ASF提供了一个**独立**于任何公司影响力的**中立空间**，保证其中的项目可以在商业友好Apache许可证2.0下繁荣发展， 为**公众利益**创建**开源软件**。

== 公开成立于1999年的公益组织

[.big]#使命: 为公众利益提供免费的软件。#

== 第一个项目

[.big]#**世界上使用最广的服务器** +
至2019已经成立24年 +
(加入ASF 20年)#

== Apache 项目涉猎领域
* 人工智能 AI
* IoT
* 大数据
* 金融管理
* 气候变化

== Apache项目还没有涉猎的领域[Yet]
* 机器人
* 自动驾驶
* 星际探索
* 区块链
* 也有可能是你的项目

== ASF 提供了项目的治理
[.big]#Apache之道#

== “Apache之道” 核心原则
* 粗略的共识和可以工作的代码
* 小的可逆步骤（进行探索）
* 任何建设性的贡献都可以获得功绩......而企业从属关系和资历却没有
* 功绩不会过期
* 功绩不给你权威; 它可以让你行使权力
* 没有独裁者，没有否决权 - 依赖于建立共识

== !
[.big]#**“Apache 之道” +
AKA +
 “社区胜于代码”**#

== ASF依托于Apache之道运作
* **精英之治**  - 个人通过他们的工作和方式获得功绩。
* **透明度**  - 我们的项目是公开开发的，所以每个想参与的人都能够参与。
* **社区**  - 我们将社区健康放在首位。

[.big]#注意不是所有的项目适合Apache之道的#

== Apache之道保证了:
* 厂商中立
* 多样性
* 可信
* 安全

== 为什么大量的项目会加入Apache
* **有社会责任感的公司** — 公益贡献
* **高质量的代码** — 众多的开发者可以从不同角度审视代码
* **合作与竞争** — 竞争对手可以通过开源项目合作共赢
* **“免费的”培训** — 通过社区培训新的开发者省时省力
* **法律保护** — ASF保护贡献者

== Apache孵化器
[.twocolumns]
--
* 提供一个官方进入Apache软件基金会途径。
* 通过导师为社区提供Apache之道的培训。

== The Apache Incubator
[.twocolumns]
--
* Takes 1-2 years sometimes longer
* Graduate to a Top Level Project
* Not all projects graduate

== Apache孵化器
[.twocolumns]
--
* 需要1-2年或更久的时间
* 逐渐成为顶级项目
* 并非每一个项目都有这样的机会

== Incubation: Build the Community
* **Users** — Users are the reason a project exists. No users ⇒ no project
* **Contributors** — Our projects depend on contributions from the community -- bug reports, email discussions, bug fixes, documentation
* **Committers** — Frequent contributors become committers after demonstrating merit
* **Project Management Committee Members** — The PMC is responsible for setting the direction of the project, authorizing releases, and voting new committers and PMC members

== 孵化器之**构建社区** 社区角色
* **用户** — 用户是项目存在的意义，没有用户意味着项目不应该存在。
* **贡献者** — 项目依赖于来自社区的贡献者们。得益于贡献者们，及时反馈bug，邮件讨论，对bug进行改正，增加文档等任务能够完成。
* **代码提交者** — 以功绩为参考项，杰出的贡献者们能够成为代码提交者。
* **项目管理委员会会员** — 项目委员会（PMC）负责制定项目的方向，批准发布以及对新的代码提交者和PMC会员投票。

== Community
* **Politeness** — Be nice
* **Respect** — Everyone’s point of view has value
* **Trust** — Assume the best intentions
* **Humility** — Others might have better ideas

Code of conduct: https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html

== 社区
* **友善** — 友善待人
* **尊重** — 每个人的意见都至关重要
* **Trust** — Assume the best intentions
* **Humility** — Others might have better ideas

Code of conduct: https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html


== Incubation: Licensing is a key aspect
* **Provenance** — Establish where every line of code originated
* **Trademarks** — Must not conflict with existing names
* **Software Grants** — The owner of the intellectual property of existing code/test/documentation must grant rights to Apache
* **Contributor Licenses** — Contributions while at Apache are governed by contributor licenses:
** Copyright
** Patent
** Distribution/Modification


== Infrastructure: Keeping the wheels on
* **Mail lists** — “If it isn't on an archived list, it didn't happen”. Communication and review are essential to project governance.
* **Source repository** — Viewing all parts of the system is open to the public. Changes are made only by committers via procedures established by the PMC.
* **Build/Test**  — Most projects now incorporate continuous integration build and test processes.
* **Establish a Web Presence** — Each project has its own unique web page https://project.apache.org

== Release distributions
* Legally an act of the Foundation
** “Does NOT need to work”
** “Does need proper licensing”
* Authorized by the Project Management Committee
** Vote required
** Digital Signature(s) required
* Distributed via extensive mirror system

== Incubation: Graduation
[.twocolumns]
--
* Demonstrate that the project can operate independently:
** Self-governance
** Release management
* Establish legal framework
* Publicity

== Who is Willem Jiang ?
* Huawei OpenSource Center Techincal Expert
* Former RedHat Principle Engineer
* Apache Member
* VP Apache ServiceComb

== Apache License
* Universal donor
* Pragmatic
* Free for commercial and non-commercial use
* Compatible with other Open Source licenses

== Releases
* Are signed
* Need an incubating disclaimer
* Have LICENSE and NOTICE files
* Follows license terms of ALv2 and any included 3rd party software
* Source files have ASF headers
* Consist of source with no compiled code

== Voting on Releases
* Vote in the open on mailing list
* Vote open for 72 hours
* Release needs to comply with ASF policy
* Needs 3 +1 votes and more +1’s than -1’s
* A -1 vote (a veto) doesn't block the release
* -1 needs to have a reason to be valid
* Can change your vote
* If vote passes then the IPMC votes on the release
* If vote fails then create new release candidate and vote again

== Why you might vote -1
* Unexpected compiled code in release
* Includes software with incompatible license
* Issue with LICENSE and NOTICE files
* Issue with copyright
* Missing ASF headers
* Contains encryption software

== Practice makes perfect
* Not expected to get it right first off
* Licensing is complex
* May not be familiar with policy
* Policy doesn't cover all situations
* Policy is more guidelines, there are few absolute rules
* Release early and release often
* Each release better than the last

== Licensing
* **Category A** - can depend on and include in release
** MIT, 2 and 3 clause BSD
* **Category B** - can depend and may be able to include
** Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL), Eclipse Public License (EPL), Mozilla Public License (MPL), Creative Common Attribution (CC-A)
* **Category X** - can't depend on or include in release
** GPL, LGPL, non commercial licenses, JSON

== Binary releases
* Are not required
* Are not official releases
* Also need to follow policy

== Growing the community
* Recognizing merit
* Initially committers == PPMC
* PPMC appoint new committers and PPMC members

== Frequently Asked Questions
* What is BDFL
* What are Rule of 3 and Rule of 72
* What is JFDI
* What are RTC/CTR
* What is Lazy Consensus

== Support The ASF
* The ASF is funded through **tax-deductible contributions** from corporations, foundations, and private individuals
* **The ASF spends 10% or less on overhead**
* ASF Infrastructure keeps Apache critical support services running 24x7x365 for **less than US$5K per project/year**
* Help keep Apache software projects **freely available to ALL** around the world
